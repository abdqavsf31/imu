# Project information #

I am doing a 3rd-year Individual Project in Mechanical Engineering in University of Southampton. My project is to develop a system that can measure 
gait trajectory during walking. A low power (lower than 3.7V powered by battery or USB) sensor system (e.g.Mebient MMRL â€“ METAMOTIONRL) would be used 
in this experiment. The sensor system will be connected to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) by wire or wireless (e.g. Bluetooth). The data from the 
sensor system will be visualised via the GUI (e.g. Andriod phone, PC).

## Build ##
The API was built in Android Studio 2.3.3 and updated to 4.1.3. 

It is targeted for Android 10/11 (SDK 30/29) with Android N (SDK 24) as the minimum required SDK, and requires a JDK compiler compliance level of 1.8.
